Requirements:
Python 2.7 (32 bit version only)

Install the required packages, NLTK and WordNik using:

$ pip install nltk
$ pip install wordnik

Copy all the information about the company and the job post
into the file named: original0. Do not leave any empty lines in between sentences

Input all the metadata of the user into the file: metadata.txt. Follow the example of metadata1.txt
You can replace the content after each colon on each line in the file skills.txt to suit your own skills.

!!! Please rid all the files of illegal characters when you copy from the web, especially to replace all
single quotation marks with '.

Navigate the the folder ./AI-prac/project

$ python
$ import main

This will then take a while to load all the required components.

To train the main classifiers:

$ gen = main.LetterGenerator()

To train the main classifiers to get one with the highest accuracy (at the cost of halving the training data size):

$ gen = main.LetterGenerator(False)

After filling all the files as mentioned above, run the program with sample 1:

$ gen.generate_cl(1)

Run the program with sample 2:

$ gen.generate_cl(2)

Run the program with the files you updated above:

$ gen.generate_cl(0)
